## About the project
Project includes source code for rewards app built by user <a href="https://github.com/naresh8t7">Naresh</a>


## Problem statement
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Â 
Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for
each customer per month and total.
- Solve using Spring Boot
- Create a RESTful endpoint
- Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
- Check solution into GitHub


## How to build
```sh
git clone git@github.com:naresh8t7/rewards.git
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot run
```

## Assumptions
- H2 in memory database with minimum DB fields required.
- Pagination of results not in scope, rest end points provides all results.
- Round amount in points calculation.
